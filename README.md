## Papers
- [Segmentation of stroke lesions using transformers-augmented
MRI analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hbm.26803)  Accurate segmentation of chronic stroke lesions from mono-spectral magnetic resonance imaging scans (e.g., T1-weighted images) is a difficult task due to the arbitrary
shape, complex texture, variable size and intensities, and varied locations of the
lesions. Due to this inherent spatial heterogeneity, existing machine learning methods
have shown moderate performance for chronic lesion delineation. In this study, we
introduced: (1) a method that integrates transformers' deformable feature attention
mechanism with convolutional deep learning architecture to improve the accuracy and
generalizability of stroke lesion segmentation, and (2) an ecological data augmentation
technique based on inserting real lesions into intact brain regions. Our combination of
these two approaches resulted in a significant increase in segmentation performance,
with a Dice index of 0.82 (Â±0.39), outperforming the existing methods trained and
tested on the same Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS) 2022 dataset.
Our method performed relatively well even for cases with small stroke lesions. We validated the robustness of our method through an ablation study and by testing it on
new unseen brain scans from the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES) 2015
dataset. Overall, our proposed approach of transformers with ecological data augmentation offers a robust way to delineate chronic stroke lesions with clinically relevant
accuracy. Our method can be extended to other challenging tasks that require automated detection and segmentation of diverse brain abnormalities from clinical scans.
