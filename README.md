# StrokeAI
A Compilation of References to AI programs for Stroke Diagnosis.

## Datasets
- [ISLES Challenge Datset](https://isles22.grand-challenge.org/dataset/), A collection of medical imaging data focused on the segmentation of ischemic stroke lesions in brain MRI scans. It is widely used for developing and evaluating machine learning models in the field of medical image analysis, particularly for stroke diagnosis and treatment planning.
- [ATLAS Dataset](https://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/retro/atlas.html), Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke, A dataset containing manual segmentations of stroke lesions on T1-weighted MRI scans from chronic stroke patients.
- [BRATS Dataset](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2020/data.html), A dataset mostly utilized for segmenting brain tumors, but is sometimes use for stroke segmentation.
